                <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE. YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE CONFIRMS YOUR UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">1. Introduction and Acceptance of Agreement</h2>
                <p><strong>1.1.</strong> Welcome to <span class="accent-keyword">Spin Samurai Casino</span> ("the Company," "we," "us," "our"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms," "Agreement") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("the Player," "you," "your") and the Company, which owns and operates this website (the "Platform").</p>
                <p><strong>1.2.</strong> This Agreement governs your use of any of the online gaming services, including real money wagering, and all related products (collectively, the "Services") offered through our Platform. We believe transparent and fair terms are the foundation of any positive <span class="accent-keyword">spin samurai casino review</span> , and we have drafted this agreement with clarity in mind.</p>
                <p><strong>1.3.</strong> By ticking the box for acceptance during the registration process and/or by using the Services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. You also acknowledge your acceptance of our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Responsible Gambling Policy, which are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.</p>
                <p><strong>1.4.</strong> If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must immediately cease using the Platform and its Services.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">2. Your Player Account</h2>
                <p><strong>2.1. Registration:</strong> To use the Services, you must first register for a personal account ("Account"). You must provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information during the registration process. It is your responsibility to maintain and promptly update your registration data.</p>
                <p><strong>2.2. Eligibility:</strong> To open an Account, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be at least 18 years of age or the legal age for gambling in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher.</li>
                    <li>Not be a resident of a jurisdiction from which we do not accept players.</li>
                    <li>Be registering the account for your sole personal use and not on behalf of any third party.</li>
                    <li>Not be a politically exposed person (PEP).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>2.3. Account Verification (KYC):</strong> We are required by law to conduct verification checks ("Know Your Customer" or KYC) to confirm your identity, age, and address. We reserve the right to request supporting documentation at any time, including, but not limited to, a copy of a government-issued photo ID, proof of address, and proof of payment method ownership. Your Account may be restricted or closed if you fail to provide the requested information in a timely manner.</p>
                <p><strong>2.4. One Account Rule:</strong> You are permitted to open and operate only one Account. If we discover that you hold more than one account, we reserve the right to treat all such accounts as a single joint account, or to close any or all of them and void any winnings.</p>
                <p><strong>2.5. Account Security:</strong> You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials (username and password). You are responsible for all activity that occurs on your Account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">3. Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>
                <p><strong>3.1. Deposits:</strong> To play for real money, you must deposit funds into your Account. You warrant that any funds deposited are not derived from any illegal activities and that you are the legal owner of the money and the payment method used.</p>
                <p><strong>3.2. Withdrawals:</strong> You may request a withdrawal of your real money balance at any time, provided that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your Account is fully verified (KYC process completed).</li>
                    <li>All deposited funds have been cleared and are not subject to any charge-back or reversal.</li>
                    <li>You have complied with all bonus wagering requirements (see Section 4).</li>
                    <li>The withdrawal is being made to a payment method registered in your own name.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>3.3. Processing:</strong> We aim to process withdrawal requests promptly. However, processing times may vary depending on the payment method and additional verification checks. We reserve the right to apply processing fees for transactions, which will be clearly stated in the cashier.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">4. Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
                <p><strong>4.1.</strong> <span class="accent-keyword">Spin Samurai Casino</span> may, from time to time, offer bonuses, free spins, and other promotions ("Promotions"). Each Promotion is subject to its own specific terms and conditions, in addition to these general Terms.</p>
                <p><strong>4.2. Wagering Requirements:</strong> Most bonuses are subject to wagering requirements (also known as "playthrough"). This is the total amount you must bet before the bonus funds and any associated winnings can be converted into your real money balance and withdrawn. The specific wagering requirement will be stated in the terms of the Promotion.</p>
                <p><strong>4.3. Game Contributions:</strong> Bets placed on different games may contribute different percentages towards fulfilling the wagering requirements. For example, slots typically contribute 100%, while table games may contribute a much smaller percentage. These details will be specified in the promotional terms.</p>
                <p><strong>4.4. Bonus Abuse:</strong> We have a zero-tolerance policy towards bonus abuse. This includes, but is not limited to, creating multiple accounts to claim a bonus multiple times, using low-risk betting strategies to unfairly complete wagering requirements, or violating any other term of a Promotion. If bonus abuse is suspected, we reserve the right to cancel the bonus, void any winnings, and close the player's account.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">5. Prohibited Activities</h2>
                <p><strong>5.1.</strong> The following activities are strictly prohibited and constitute a material breach of these Terms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engaging in any fraudulent, collusive, or illegal activity.</li>
                    <li>Using any software-assisted methods or techniques (including "bots" or artificial intelligence) to play games.</li>
                    <li>Attempting to manipulate or exploit any bug, error, or loophole in our software.</li>
                    <li>Using our Services for the purpose of money laundering or terrorist financing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>5.2.</strong> If we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have engaged in any prohibited activity, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account, void any wagers, and retain any funds in your Account, including deposits, to cover damages and costs.</p>
