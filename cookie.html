                            <h2 class="h3 mt-5">1. Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Welcome to <span class="accent-keyword">Spin Samurai Casino</span> . This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website ("the Platform"). It outlines what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them. We are committed to transparency and to providing a secure and personalized gaming experience for all our players.</p>

                            <h2 class="h3 mt-5">2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
                            <p>Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used by website owners to make their websites function, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and remember user preferences.</p>
                            <p>Cookies can be categorized as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These are temporary and are deleted from your device when you close your web browser.</li>
                                <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> These remain on your device for a set period or until you manually delete them.</li>
                                <li><strong>First-party Cookies:</strong> These are set by the website you are visiting (in this case, us, <span class="accent-keyword">Spin Samurai Casino</span> ).</li>
                                <li><strong>Third-party Cookies:</strong> These are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting, such as our analytics or advertising partners.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 class="h3 mt-5">3. How and Why We Use Cookies</h2>
                            <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several important reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our Platform to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience.</p>
                            <p>The specific types of cookies we use and the purposes they perform are described below:</p>
                            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">3.1. Strictly Necessary Cookies:</h3>
                            <p>These are essential for you to navigate the Platform and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as accessing secure areas of the website (logging in), managing your account, and processing financial transactions, cannot be provided. These cookies are fundamental to the operation of the Platform.</p>
                            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">3.2. Performance and Analytics Cookies:</h3>
                            <p>These cookies collect anonymous information about how visitors use our Platform. For example, they help us understand which pages are most popular, how long visitors spend on our site, and if they encounter any error messages. The data gathered is aggregated and anonymous and is used exclusively to improve how <span class="accent-keyword">Spin Samurai Casino</span> functions and to enhance the overall user experience.</p>
                            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">3.3. Functionality Cookies:</h3>
                            <p>These cookies allow the Platform to remember choices you make to provide a more personalized and convenient experience. For instance, they can remember your username, preferred language, or the currency you use. This personalization is a key feature we believe any thorough <span class="accent-keyword">spin samurai casino review</span> should highlight, as it creates a smoother journey for the player. For our players at <span class="accent-keyword">spin samurai casino canada</span> , this can include remembering your preference for CAD currency and showing you relevant regional promotions.</p>
                            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">3.4. Marketing and Targeting Cookies:</h3>
                            <p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission.</p>

                            <h2 class="h3 mt-5">4. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
